# Discipline Check

Invoke this skill when you need to verify if your current session or a completed task meets the high standards of the Superpowers framework.

## Self-Evaluation Checklist

### 1. Planning
- [ ] Did I use the `brainstorming` skill BEFORE the `implementation_plan`?
- [ ] Is the `implementation_plan` comprehensive and approved by the user?
- [ ] Are all files grouped by component?

### 2. Execution
- [ ] Am I using the `task_boundary` tool correctly (PredictedTaskSize, Mode, TaskName, etc.)?
- [ ] Is my `task.md` updated after every logical step?
- [ ] Am I avoiding "placeholders" and "summarized" code in my edits?

### 3. Verification
- [ ] Did I run automated tests for every change?
- [ ] Does my `walkthrough.md` contain "Evidence First" (terminal logs, screenshots)?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged mistakes or backtracking in my narrative?

## The "Vipassana" Test
Before every action, ask:
> "Am I acting out of habit or am I grounded in a skill?"
