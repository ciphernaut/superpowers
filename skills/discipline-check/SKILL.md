# Discipline Check

Invoke this skill to verify if your code and session structure meet the high standards of the Superpowers framework.

## Quality Checklist

### 1. Logic Density
- [ ] Is the code "dense" (avoiding boilerplate where possible)?
- [ ] Have I used native platform features effectively?
- [ ] Are functions focused on a single responsibility?

### 2. Naming & Clarity
- [ ] Are variable names descriptive but concise?
- [ ] Is the documentation free of "fluff" and "meta-talk"?
- [ ] Does the `walkthrough.md` focus on evidence rather than narrative?

### 3. Session Efficiency
- [ ] Have I minimized unnecessary tool calls (e.g., redundant `ls` or `view_file`)?
- [ ] Am I keeping my `task_boundary` updates meaningful?

## Self-Audit
> "If a human reviewer saw this session, would they find it professional and efficient?"
