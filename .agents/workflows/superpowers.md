# Superpowers Activation Workflow

1. **Bootstrap**: Read and follow the Protocol in `.antigravity/bootstrap.md`.
2. **Deep Dive**: Consult `docs/ANTIGRAVITY.md` for tool mappings, templates, and historical context if required.
3. **Skills**: Search for relevant skills in `skills/` when starting a task.
4. **Execute**: Invoke skills by reading `SKILL.md` before proceeding.
5. **Quality**: Use the `discipline-check` skill before major milestones to ensure quality standards are met.
