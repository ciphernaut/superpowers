# Superpowers Activation Workflow

1. **Bootstrap**: Read and follow the Antigravity Protocol in `.antigravity/bootstrap.md`.
2. **Tooling**: Consult `.antigravity/tool-mapping.md` for mapping Superpowers instructions to your native tools.
3. **Skills**: Search for relevant skills in `skills/` when starting a task.
4. **Execute**: If a skill applies, invoke it by reading its `SKILL.md` file BEFORE proceeding. Discover the skill by searching in the `skills/` directory relative to the Superpowers repository root.
5. **Reflect**: In the `TaskStatus` of your `task_boundary`, acknowledge which skill is providing the grounding for your next action.
6. **Vipassana**: Maintain self-awareness of your own workflow. Acknowledge your current "mode" (PLANNING, EXECUTION, VERIFICATION) in every `task_boundary` call.

7. Verify the installation by listing the skills:
```bash
ls ./skills
```
